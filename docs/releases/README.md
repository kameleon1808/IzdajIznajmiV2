# Release Notes Structure

Release notes are grouped by domain to improve discoverability for support and ongoing development.

## Naming convention
`<topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`

## Current domains
- `chat/`
- `notifications/`
- `verification/`

## Guidelines for new entries
- Keep incident details, root cause, and remediation in the same release note.
- Include affected files/endpoints and post-deploy verification steps.
- Add follow-up runbook updates when operational behavior changes.
